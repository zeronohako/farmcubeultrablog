## Smart Farming, Crunchy Results

### Inside the Farm Cube Ultra: Rethinking Urban Farming

I’m working as a pilot intern with Farm Cube Ultra Korea, exploring the future of indoor farming within the city. Since 2023, this project has entered its second year, with the goal of testing how smart farming systems can be integrated into the fabric of urban life—a perspective I connect to my studies in Urban Studies.

Through Lettuce Lab Notes, I document the journey of cultivating lettuce inside the Farm Cube Ultra:

- Tracking growth cycles to reach the “dream harvest” of 28 days
- Experimenting with LED spectrums, nutrient mixes, and environmental settings
- Investigating distribution channels, market pricing, and packaging
- Sharing the taste tests, challenges, and milestones that shape this pilot farm

While lettuce is our first test crop, the long-term vision of Farm Cube Ultra is broader—scaling to other crops like herbs, leafy greens, and even strawberries. This blog begins with lettuce, but it also points toward a future where diverse produce can be grown sustainably inside our cities.

Whether you’re curious about urban farming, sustainable cities, or the intersection of technology and community, join me in Lettuce Lab Notes, where I explore how lettuce grown inside a cube can spark bigger questions about the future of our food and our cities.
